Moreover, the features that belong to each group, and the important feature groups may vary per sample. But what do we mean by feature redundancy? In this paper, we formally define two types of redundancies using information theory: Representation and Relevant redundancies. We leverage these redundancies to design a formulation for instance-wise feature group discovery and reveal a theoretical guideline to help discover the appropriate number of groups. We approximate mutual information via a variational lower bound and learn the feature group and selector indicators with Gumbel-Softmax in optimizing our formulation. Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical claims. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and gene expression datasets show that our method discovers feature groups with high classification accuracies.","tags":null,"title":"Instance-wise Feature Grouping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guangyu Zhu","Tingting Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"48b5a97c759bf78c8c8d8edec6216864","permalink":"/publication/2020-gknock/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-gknock/","section":"publication","summary":"Feature selection is central to contemporary high-dimensional data analysis. Grouping structure among features arises naturally in various scientific problems. Many methods have been proposed to incorporate the grouping structure information into feature selection. However, these methods are normally restricted to a linear regression setting. To relax the linear constraint, we combine Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with the recent Knockoffs technique, which has been successful in an individual feature selection context. We propose Deep group-feature selection using Knockoffs (Deep-gKnock) as a methodology for model interpretation and dimension reduction. Deep-gKnock performs model-free group-feature selection by controlling group-wise False Discovery Rate (gFDR). Our method improves the interpretability and reproducibility of DNNs. Experimental results on both high-dimensional synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves superior power and accurate gFDR control compared with state-of-the-art methods..","tags":null,"title":"Deep-gKnock: nonlinear group-feature selection with deep neural network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tingting Zhao","Zifeng Wang","Aria Masoomi","Jennifer Dy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566950400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566950400,"objectID":"a3baa15cb336ed16e530bbd1e5567b44","permalink":"/publication/19-streaminganvae/","publishdate":"2019-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/19-streaminganvae/","section":"publication","summary":"Lifelong Learning (LL) refers to the ability to continually learn and solve new problems with incremental available information over time while retaining previous knowledge. Much attention has been given lately to Supervised Lifelong Learning (SLL) with a stream of labelled data. In contrast, we focus on resolving challenges in Unsupervised Lifelong Learning (ULL) with streaming unlabelled data when the data distribution and the unknown class labels evolve over time. Bayesian framework is natural to incorporate past knowledge and sequentially update the belief with new data. We develop a fully Bayesian inference framework for ULL with a novel end-to-end Deep Bayesian Unsupervised Lifelong Learning (DBULL) algorithm, which can progressively discover new clusters without forgetting the past with unlabelled data while learning latent representations. To efficiently maintain past knowledge, we develop a novel knowledge preservation mechanism via sufficient statistics of the latent representation for raw data. To detect the potential new clusters on the fly, we develop an automatic cluster discovery and redundancy removal strategy in our inference inspired by Nonparametric Bayesian statistics techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using image and text corpora benchmark datasets in both LL and batch settings.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Bayesian Unsupervised Lifelong Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tingting Zhao","Alexandre Bouchard-Côté"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535414400,"objectID":"5086fd555ee1fd303f242d2905bf28c2","permalink":"/publication/18-highdimensionalctmc/","publishdate":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18-highdimensionalctmc/","section":"publication","summary":"Sampling the parameters of high-dimensional Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC) is a challenging problem with important applications in many fields of applied statistics. In this work a recently proposed type of non-reversible rejection-free Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS), is brought to bear to this problem. BPS has demonstrated its favourable computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art MCMC algorithms, however to date applications to real-data scenario were scarce. An important aspect of practical implementation of BPS is the simulation of event times. Default implementations use conservative thinning bounds. Such bounds can slow down the algorithm and limit the computational performance. Our paper develops an algo- rithm with exact analytical solution to the random event times in the context of CTMCs. Our local version of BPS algorithm takes advantage of the sparse structure in the target factor graph and we also provide a framework for assessing the computational complexity of local BPS algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of high-dimensional Continuous Time Markov Chains using the Local Bouncy Particle Sampler","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tingting Zhao","Ziyu Wang","Alexander Cumberworth"," Joerg Gsponer","Nando de Freitas","Alexandre Bouchard-Côté"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1473379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473379200,"objectID":"367f646aac325507b5240f0c8de5ae65","permalink":"/publication/16-ba-ctmc/","publishdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/16-ba-ctmc/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian analysis of continuous time, discrete state space time series is an important and challenging problem, where incomplete observation and large parameter sets call for user-defined priors based on known properties of the process. Generalized linear models have a largely unexplored potential to construct such prior distributions. We show that an important challenge with Bayesian generalized linear modelling of continuous time Markov chains is that classical Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are too ineffective to be practical in that setup. We address this issue using an auxiliary variable construction combined with an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. This sampling algorithm and model make it efficient both in terms of computation and analyst’s time to construct stochastic processes informed by prior knowledge, such as known prop- erties of the states of the process. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our framework using synthetic and real phylogenetic protein data, where a prior based on amino acid physicochemical properties is constructed to obtain accurate rate matrix estimates.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Analysis of Continuous Time Markov Chains with Application to Phylogenetic Modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tingting Zhao","Jiyin Zhao","Ruirui Zheng","Lulu Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1283990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1283990400,"objectID":"3fbf546cc022353cd36f27b48e390021","permalink":"/publication/rmb/","publishdate":"2010-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rmb/","section":"publication","summary":"BP artificial neural network based on genetic algorithm training method was proposed in this paper to solving Renminbi (RMB) number recognition and artificial neural network BP algorithm problems in order to satisfy the technical requirements of financial sector sorter.
