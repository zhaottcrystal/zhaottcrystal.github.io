Our approach, Adaptive Non-parametric Variational Autoencoder (AdapVAE), learns the cluster membership through a Bayesian Nonparametric (BNP) modeling framework with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for feature learning. We develop a joint online variational inference algorithm to learn feature representations and clustering assignments simultaneously via iteratively optimizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). We resolve the catastrophic forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) challenges with streaming data by adopting generative samples from the trained AdapVAE using previous data, which avoids the need of storing and reusing past data. We demonstrate the advantages of our model including adaptive novel cluster detection without discarding useful information learned from past data, high quality sample generation and comparable clustering performance as end-to-end batch mode clustering methods on both image and text corpora benchmark datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Streaming Adaptive Nonparametric Variational Autoencoder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tingting Zhao","Alexandre Bouchard-Côté"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535414400,"objectID":"5086fd555ee1fd303f242d2905bf28c2","permalink":"/publication/18-highdimensionalctmc/","publishdate":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18-highdimensionalctmc/","section":"publication","summary":"Sampling the parameters of high-dimensional Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC) is a challenging problem with important applications in many fields of applied statistics. In this work a recently proposed type of non-reversible rejection-free Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS), is brought to bear to this problem. BPS has demonstrated its favourable computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art MCMC algorithms, however to date applications to real-data scenario were scarce. An important aspect of practical implementation of BPS is the simulation of event times. Default implementations use conservative thinning bounds. Such bounds can slow down the algorithm and limit the computational performance. Our paper develops an algo- rithm with exact analytical solution to the random event times in the context of CTMCs. Our local version of BPS algorithm takes advantage of the sparse structure in the target factor graph and we also provide a framework for assessing the computational complexity of local BPS algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of high-dimensional Continuous Time Markov Chains using the Local Bouncy Particle Sampler","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tingting Zhao","Ziyu Wang","Alexander Cumberworth"," Joerg Gsponer","Nando de Freitas","Alexandre Bouchard-Côté"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1473379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473379200,"objectID":"367f646aac325507b5240f0c8de5ae65","permalink":"/publication/16-ba-ctmc/","publishdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/16-ba-ctmc/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian analysis of continuous time, discrete state space time series is an important and challenging problem, where incomplete observation and large parameter sets call for user-defined priors based on known properties of the process. Generalized linear models have a largely unexplored potential to construct such prior distributions. We show that an important challenge with Bayesian generalized linear modelling of continuous time Markov chains is that classical Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are too ineffective to be practical in that setup. We address this issue using an auxiliary variable construction combined with an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. This sampling algorithm and model make it efficient both in terms of computation and analyst’s time to construct stochastic processes informed by prior knowledge, such as known prop- erties of the states of the process. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our framework using synthetic and real phylogenetic protein data, where a prior based on amino acid physicochemical properties is constructed to obtain accurate rate matrix estimates.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Analysis of Continuous Time Markov Chains with Application to Phylogenetic Modelling","type":"publication"}]
